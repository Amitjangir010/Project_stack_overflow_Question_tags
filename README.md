# Project_stack_overflow_Question_tags

## About
This project helps with Stack Overflow tags. It analyses questions and tries to work out the best tags for them. This can make finding questions you're interested in easier.

## Goal
We want to make it easier to find and organize questions on Stack Overflow by improving how tags are used.

## How It Works
- **Preparing Data**: We get the questions ready to use in our models.
- **Model making**: We build a tool that guesses the right tags for a question.
- **Checking Our work**: We see how good our tool is at guessing tags.

- **Model Development**: We utilized an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, incorporating GloVe 6B 100d embeddings for advanced word representation. This combination allows for more accurate prediction of relevant tags.
